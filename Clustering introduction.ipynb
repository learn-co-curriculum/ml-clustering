    "- In cluster analysis, an **agglomerative hierarchical** algorithm starts with *n* clusters (where *n* is the number of observations, so each observation is a cluster), then combines the two most similar clusters, combines the next two most similar clusters, and so on. A **divisive** hierarchical algorithm does the exact opposite, going from 1 to *n* clusters.\n",

    "- A **nonhierarchical** algorithm chooses *k* initial clusters and reassigns observations until no improvement can be obtained. How initial clusters and reassignemnts are done depends on the specific type of algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "An essential understanding when using clustering methods is that you are basically trying to group data points together without actually knowing what the _actual_ cluster/classes are. This is also the main distinction between clustering and classification (which is a *supervised* learning method). This is why technically, you also don't know how many clusters you're looking for."
