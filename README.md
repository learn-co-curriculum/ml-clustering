# ml-k-means-clustering

Introduction:
- Search for k (so, a predetermined amount of) clusters within an unlabeled data set
- Cluster center: arithmetic mean of all points in one cluster
- Each point in one cluster is closer to its cluster center than to other cluster centers
- Visualize this for a data set with 2 variables

The math behind k-means clustering (part I)
- The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm: how it works
   - First “random guess” of cluster means
   - Expectation step
   - Maximization step
   - Repeat until convergence

- The EM algorithm: show a visual example of how clusters change each iteration
